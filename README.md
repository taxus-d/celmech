an attemt to improve initial conditions of eight-shaped orbit using poincare sections and weird coordinate transformations

Main time-consuming features:

*  `Integrator` class (fairly abstract one)
*  Poincare sections, somewhat crutchy
*  transformations to shape space
* shape space Euler-Lagrange equations (in `Celmech.f90`)
